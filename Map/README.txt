The code is run in StreetMap, using the command line arguments in main. The class Edge is a representation of roads, Node is a representation of intersections, and Graph is an ADT graph implementation. For extra credit, the map window has two text fields and a button. When two valid intersections have been entered into the text fields (and make sure to click enter/return each time, it will print the intersection IDs to the screen as well, so you know that youâ€™ve hit enter), if the button is clicked, the shortest path will be calculated between the two intersections, given one exists.
