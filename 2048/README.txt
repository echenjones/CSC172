The game is run by running the class Project1. A GUI window will pop up, and it is important that the GUI is the window being used, otherwise the key listener won’t pick up user input. The keys to use, as in the assignment are ‘w’ for up, ‘a’ for left, ‘s’ for down, ‘d’ for right, ‘q’ for quit, ‘r’ for restart, ‘y’ for yes, and ‘n’ for no. The game ends when the board is full and an invalid move is made.
